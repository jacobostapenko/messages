## Clone project:

```git clone https://github.com/jacobostapenko/messages.git```

Next set up a virtualenv to deal with dependencies

```python3.8 -m venv .```

Remember to add the venv to you .git-ignore. 

Start your virtual env using
```source bin/activate```

install the dependencies needed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can check if the install was successful using `django-admin --version` and 3.2 should appear.

## To Update `Requirements.txt`:
You can simply run `pip install XXX` where `XXX` is the package you want to use. Next, run
 `diff -u requirements.txt <(pip freeze)` and see what has changed in the file and make those updates

## Setup DB

Install Postgres 15 from here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
Run Postgress and click on the default DB created for you. This should open a Terminal shell. Run the commands below to
create the DB needed

To add psql to the path of the virtual environment, run the following commands(for regular installation of postgreSQL):

export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/15/bin:$PATH"

make sure to change version(number after PostgreSQL/) if your postgres version is different

to create the database, run ./manage.py dbshell and type the following commands

```CREATE DATABASE messageboard;```

```
CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'password';
ALTER ROLE admin SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE admin SET timezone TO 'UTC';
```
and then leave via `exit`.

Remember to create an admin user by running the following command:
./manage.py createsuperuser
it will ask for a username and password that you will need to remember to access django admin.


Once running:
To clear the database from previous messages, run 

./manage.py flush


To udpate the db / migrate before you run the server:

open up a shell, and go into your virtual environment. Change directories to end up in the messageboard directory. Run the commands below:

./manage.py makemigration

./manage.py migrate


## Accessing the Admin Console
TODO: add this info and create mock data for DB


to launch:
1. cd to app dir
2. run in console: $ python ./manage.py runserver


admin user creds:
username: user1 password: password

to create user, either go into the django admin or add in shell using .create_user(username, password='_ex_')


to populate db, for now manually add stuff in through admin
